### Overview

Alain Colmerauer (24 January 1941 – 12 May 2017) was a French computer scientist. He was a professor at Aix-Marseille University, and the creator of the logic programming language Prolog.

### Early Life

He earned a degree in computer science from the Institut polytechnique de Grenoble (Grenoble Institute of Technology) in 1963, and a doctorate in the discipline in 1967 from the École nationale supérieure d'informatique et de mathématiques appliquées de Grenoble, which is part of the Institut.

### Before Prolog

Alain Colmerauer spent 1967–1970 as assistant professor at the University of Montreal, where he created Q-Systems, a method of directed graph transformations according to given grammar rules. Colmerauer moved to the University of Aix-Marseille at Luminy in 1970 as Professeur 2ème classe (associate professor). He was promoted in 1979 to Professeur 1ère classe (Full Professor), and in 1988 to Professeur classe exceptionnelle (University Professor).

### The Making of Prolog

He was the center of a research group that, in the early 1970s, first conceived of Prolog (an abbreviation for "programmation en logique," which is French for "programming in logic"), a general-purpose logic programming language rooted in first-order logic that is well-suited for tasks that benefit from rule-based logical queries such as searching databases, voice control systems, and filling templates.
In 1972, Colmerauer worked with Philippe Roussel to develop the first Prolog system; its first implementations were interpreters.

### RIP
Alain Colmerauer, a great computer scientist and of course a father of the logic programming language Prolog, sadly passed away on May 15 at the age of 76 in 2017.
